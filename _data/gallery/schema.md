# Gallery Schema

An entry in the gallery is identified by its key. (For example, `andi.reference`, which can be addressed globally as `site.gallery.andi.reference`.)

The following values belong to a gallery entry:

* `thumb`: The path to a 200x200px image to be used as the thumbnail in the gallery.
* `max`: The path to a full-resolution version of the image.
